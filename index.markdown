I currently work as a machine learning researcher in the [Curious AI company](https://thecuriousaicompany.com/). I am also a co-founder of [Enne Analytics](https://www.enneanalytics.com/), a company which provides data science related consulting.

I have a Ph.D. in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, which I completed under supervision of Professor [Aki Vehtari](http://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning group](http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml) at Aalto University in 2019. My thesis deals with predictive inference and feature selection for scarce but high-dimensional data using generalized linear models and Gaussian processes (see [Publications](/publications/)).

My current work at Curious AI deals mostly with neural networks and model predictive control, but I have a wide interest in different statistical methodologies and applications in various areas.
