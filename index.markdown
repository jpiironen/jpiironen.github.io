I currently work as a lead scientist for the [Top Data Science company](https://topdatascience.com/). Before that I used to work as a machine learning researcher at the [Curious AI company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-curious-ai-company/?originalSubdomain=fi).

I have a Ph.D. in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, which I completed under supervision of Professor [Aki Vehtari](http://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning group](http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml) at Aalto University in 2019. My thesis deals with predictive inference and feature selection for scarce but high-dimensional data using generalized linear models and Gaussian processes (see [Publications](/publications/)).

Most of my work during recent years has focused on neural networks and model predictive control, but I have a wide interest in different machine learning techniques and applications in various areas.
